                <p>
                    As a UX Designer, I was responsible for ensuring the accessibility of our website for people with disabilities and adhering to WCAG 2.0 guidelines. I was instrumental in applying user-centered design principles and creating visual designs that aligned with our company's style guides and branding guidelines. I ensured that all web pages were compatible with major browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. I conducted research to stay up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques for accessibility auditing and compliance with company products. I also collaborated with the team to generate empathy maps for our existing products, leading to a more user-centered design approach. Additionally, I reviewed and analyzed user interface design and content for errors, areas of improvement, and compliance with company standards. Throughout my experience, I gained a deep understanding of the UX design field through conducting extensive industry research.
